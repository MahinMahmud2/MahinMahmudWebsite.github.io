                <p>My junior year in High School, I joined the Stuyvesant Wrestling team. This was one of my greatest decisions of all time. I have competed in several tournaments for my school in New York City. Our team placed second in Borough Championships in 2023. </p>

                <p>As a Muslim myself, I felt inclined to join this group. As a team we competed in the Muslim Interscholastic Tournament (Mist) and won first place this year, 2023. Working as a team not only built better interpersonal relationships, but developed our communication skills and team-building capabilities. </p>
